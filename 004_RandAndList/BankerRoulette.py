# Banker Roulette v1.0
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Instructions
# -----------------------------------------------------
# You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
# Important: You are not allowed to use the choice() function.
# Line 8 splits the string names_string into individual names and puts them inside a List called names. For this to work, you must enter all the names as names followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name
# Example Input
# Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
# Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.
# Example Output
# Michael is going to buy the meal today!
# Hint
#     You might need the help of the len() function.

#     Remember that Lists start at index 0!
# Testing Your Code
# Check your code is doing what it is supposed to. When you're happy with your code, click submit to check your solution. Your program may look like it is failing the tests when it isn't. We're using the random functionality in this exercise, so the tests will match different outcomes. 
# -----------------------------------------------------

# Import the random module here
import random

# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

print(f"{random.choice(names)} is going to buy the meal today!")
