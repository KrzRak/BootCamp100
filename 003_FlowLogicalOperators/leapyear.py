# Leap year v1.0
# -----------------------------------------------------
# Instructions
# -----------------------------------------------------
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
#     on every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
#     **except** every year that is evenly divisible by 100 
#     **unless** the year is also evenly divisible by 400

# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.
# But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
# 2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)
# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.
